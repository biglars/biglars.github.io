Bob Villa dove tail joint Batman. &nbsp;Seems they made that cut and
did the reversal there so there was enough slack to pull the wound
closed. &nbsp;Then, when that was done, they did the graft with the
sizzlean they cut out of my thigh. &nbsp;Nifty.<br><br><br><img style="width: 320px; height: 240px;" alt="k" src="IMG_4882.JPG"><br>I
have NOTHING to replace the yellow surgical tape with so that guy is
staying until I can get to the surgeon for a real dressing change and
not just this makeshift shit I'm doing. &nbsp;I got it cleaned up, let
it air out for 15 minutes. &nbsp;Felt fine, no pain or anything, just
sore.<br><br><br><img style="width: 320px; height: 240px;" alt="u" src="IMG_4885.JPG"><br>This
is my dining room circa 6:30pm... Blech... &nbsp;Thanks JFK... Feel
better though. &nbsp;Got those shitty bandages off, cleaned it up and
covered it with clean guaze. &nbsp;I will go to Walgreens or Rite Aid
tomorrow and get all the supplies I need to do it right on Friday.
&nbsp;DIY!! &nbsp;Hack your Own Leg!!<br><br>I did need an assist to dress the wound completely though... <br><br>---<br><br><br></div></body></html>
