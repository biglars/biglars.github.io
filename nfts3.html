As bizarre as it sounds, this is the best it's looked. &nbsp;The
pink around the center scab used to be a purple haze and you can see
areas scabbing over.<br>
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 320px; height: 240px;" alt="h" src="IMG_4913.JPG"><br>
Doesn't look much different, it's healing slowly, but there is
progress...<br>

The center scab by the graft looked better than it has in the past<br>
<br>
This is going to take a while to heal, but it's not infected and there
is visible progress. &nbsp;Color me happy...</div>
