    <br>Will come back and flesh this section out with pictures of the first go round later...<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 282px; height: 282px;" alt="l" src="IMG_4726.JPG"> &nbsp; &nbsp;<img style="width: 157px; height: 281px;" alt="l" src="IMG_4724.JPG"> &nbsp;<img style="width: 382px; height: 285px;" alt="n" src="IMG_4483%20%28Small%29.JPG"><br></div>----<br><br>

    Monday, October 17th: &nbsp; My first visit post "second" surgery.&nbsp; Due to a
    scheduling snafu my ortho, Nilesh Patel, is not on duty, but I get
    Dr. Ramadi to look at me.&nbsp; In Dr's office the staff removes my
    bandages.&nbsp; The wound is a black bloody mess.&nbsp; The stitches have
    popped out.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is clearly infected.&nbsp; You can see the Achilles
    tendon through the hole in the leg.&nbsp; They re-wrap it, put me on
    Keflex (antibiotic) and tell me to return to see Nilesh (Dr. Patel) the next
    morning at 8am.<br>

    <br>

    Tuesday, October 18th:&nbsp; I rise and go directly to see Dr. Patel.&nbsp; He
    knows what's coming but is shocked by the damage.&nbsp; He scheduled me
    for emergency debridement/clean up surgery that night and tells me I
    will likely spend the night at JFK.&nbsp; I go at 3pm to check in, get
    processed and am under the knife by 6pm.&nbsp; I wake in recovery at
    8pm.&nbsp; Pain is not so bad.&nbsp; They take me to room 3135 in the ortho
    wing at Kennedy.&nbsp; I did not know it at the time, but it will become
    my home for five days.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 388px; height: 291px;" alt="l" src="hospital%20%28Small%29.png"><br>Kenny got my laptop to me fast so I would not go into DTs<br></div>

    <br>

    &nbsp; The debridement went well.&nbsp; There was not enough tissue to close
    the wound on the back of my leg so the doctors are using a "wound
    VAC" where a sponge is placed in the gap and negative atmospheric
    pressure is applied to bring the wound together and to keep the
    nearby skin dry and not wet with seepage.&nbsp; I have a hole in the back
    of my leg with a black sponge hooked up to a shop vac in it.&nbsp;
    Tired.&nbsp; Need some sleep. &nbsp;Black sponge is a great band name.<br>

    <br>

    Wednesday, October 19th:&nbsp; Though I was going home today.&nbsp; Run
    through a bazillion blood tests.&nbsp; Met with plastic surgeons.&nbsp; They
    will perform surgery next week to close the wound.&nbsp; Want a consult
    on Monday, 10/24 and to operate on 10/26.&nbsp; Good, less time with the
    Kirby vacuum in my leg.&nbsp; Talk with some nurse at home people about
    doing my own IVs and running the wound vac for a few days.&nbsp; Eating
    well.&nbsp; Told at 4pm that they cannot find a portable wound vac by end
    of day so I need to stay in the hospital.&nbsp; Not thrilled, but no big
    deal.&nbsp; One day closer to surgery to close wound and I have
    professionals keeping the hole in the back of my leg clean.<br><br>Actually a cool process - <blockquote type="cite">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative-pressure_wound_therapy</blockquote><br><div style="text-align: center;"><br><img style="width: 308px; height: 210px;" alt="w" src="wv.jpg"> &nbsp;<img style="width: 278px; height: 208px;" alt="ll" src="IMG_4767.JPG"> &nbsp;<img style="width: 285px; height: 210px;" alt="jj" src="IMG_4768.JPG"><br></div>

    <br>

    Thursday, October 20th:&nbsp; TODAY I'm going home.&nbsp; Leg wound re
    bandaged.&nbsp; Man, what a mess.&nbsp; Lots of meds and antibiotics.&nbsp; I keep
    asking on check out procedure.&nbsp; No one will give me a clear answer.&nbsp;
    Am told at 4pm that the infectious disease doctor will not clear me
    to go home.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; I talk to my Ortho and he says not to worry on
    it, that they will just do antibiotics and we can still do surgery
    on next Wed.&nbsp; Good, all I care about.&nbsp; But why can't I go home?&nbsp;
    Been here two days, the wound vac portable is here.&nbsp; Have
    instructions on nursing service for antibiotics.&nbsp; Nurses installed a
    PICC line in my arm today to make IVs easy.&nbsp; I'm ready to go.&nbsp;
    Doctor says the culture is not back from the surgery on Tuesday so
    she cannot release me.&nbsp; In retrospect, I think they double checked
    before telling me what was going on.&nbsp; Read on...<br><br><img style="width: 320px; height: 240px;" alt="l" src="IMG_4764.JPG"><br>Having only one leg to stand on I am a Fall Risk, another great band name...<br>

    <br>

    Friday, October 21th:&nbsp; The day of the Curveball.&nbsp; I wake at 7am and
    notice that the nurses are whispering and hanging some weird supply
    bag on my door.&nbsp; Now when they come in they have gowns and gloves
    on.&nbsp; A nurse comes in and wants to take blood.&nbsp; She tells me that I
    was positive for a bacteria in my culture.&nbsp; The infectious disease
    doctor will be in to talk to me later to discuss antibiotic
    treatment.&nbsp; OK, I guess it's no big deal.&nbsp; I am not quarantined, I
    am "contact precaution."<br><div style="text-align: center;"><br><img style="width: 398px; height: 199px;" alt="m" src="mrsa.jpg"> &nbsp;<img style="width: 371px; height: 195px;" alt="p" src="purple.jpg"><br></div><br>

    &nbsp; Finally I get why the nurses were acting the way they were.&nbsp; I
    have MRSA.&nbsp; The wound infection was a MRSA infection, the super bug
    that is resilient to 50 different types of antibiotics.&nbsp; People are
    running around like it's the andromeda strain.&nbsp; I talk to the doc
    and it turns out we have to try a bunch of Vancomysin antibiotic (it
    still knocks out MRSA) and some other types, so they start testing.&nbsp;
    Antibiotic, bloodwork, antibiotic, bloodwork, my left arm is blown
    out with needles.&nbsp; I will not be cleared to go home by docs w this
    in my system.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;
Now a narrative that makes sense is forming though. &nbsp;I have had
MRSA in my system the whole time. &nbsp;It slowed the healing of the
first AT repair and made it weak and it infected the second one at the
incision point. &nbsp;NOW my experiences are making sense (as much
sense as they can with a PICC in your arm and a sponge in your leg).<br><br>Friends all came Fri night, dressed in gowns and made
    asses of themselves so it was fun.&nbsp; I will be here Saturday.<br><br><img style="width: 230px; height: 172px;" alt="k" src="IMG_4790.JPG"> &nbsp;<img style="width: 236px; height: 177px;" alt="m" src="IMG_4770.JPG"> <img style="width: 212px; height: 178px;" alt="h" src="IMG_4771.JPG"><br><br><br>Saturday,
October 22nd:&nbsp; Was told early that I would not be cleared until
Sunday earliest. &nbsp;Sunday looks good for release now, but I've
heard that before. Then again, Cubs are in the series so anythong is
possible... &nbsp;Maureen came to visit. &nbsp;Peter in afternoon.
&nbsp;Howie, always a good time at JFK.<br><br>&nbsp;Will update more on Sunday<br><span style="color: rgb(17, 17, 17); font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;"></span><br></body></html>
